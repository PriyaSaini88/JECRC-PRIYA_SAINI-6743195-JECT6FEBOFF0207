Specific Exception Handling :

try:
    problem Statement

    resolution/
    solution code

# try:
#     print(a, b, c)

'''
Generic Exception Handling 

It is a type of exception handling approach in which there is no need to pass any particular exception class name. Instead we can use parent 'exception'
class called "Exception".
-- Using "Generic Exception Hnadling", we can't handle keyword interruption.
